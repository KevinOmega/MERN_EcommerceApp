# MERN Ecommerce App With Authentication

This is an eCommerce app simulation for the purpose of practicing and trying to improve my skills.
You can feel free to the page and play around with the fake products, you can't really buy anything there, it's just to show that the functionality works.

This project has been made up with Mongoose (MongoDB), Express , Passport and React Redux.
